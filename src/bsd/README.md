# Billing Strategy & Design Application (Frontend)
## BSD application is designed to consume the backend api endpoint and display the result like : compare two files ( MEC and CSG).

#
## Developer Setup Tools / Guide
- Node - Install Node from Software Center.
- IDE -  Visual Studio/ATOM.
- Install git as version tool in your local.
- Git Lab URL :  clone this Uri https://gitlab.spectrumflow.net/bpe/bsd-react-frontend.git to local repo and run:  `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

- In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`

- Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser.

## React Components

- React components are the building blocks of a React application. They are self-contained pieces of UI that can be easily reused and combined to build complex user interfaces.

## Virtual DOM

- React uses a virtual DOM to render components efficiently and update the user interface in response to user interactions and data changes. The virtual DOM acts as an intermediary between the React components and the actual DOM, making it possible to update the UI with minimal rendering overhead.

## JSX

- React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to define components and their UI. JSX makes it possible to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, providing a concise and expressive way to define UI.

## State and Props

- React components use state and props to manage data and behavior. State is a mutable object that represents the local state of a component, while props are immutable values that are passed down from parent components to their children.

## Webpack

- React applications are typically built using a module bundler as Webpack. These tools take the application's source code and dependencies and produce a single, optimized JavaScript file that can be served to the browser.

## XLSX

- XLSX library is useful for parse any complex spreadsheet data. it also used for generating new spreadsheets from json and other fromat data

## Redux

- Redux is helps us to write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments  and are easy to test

## Redux Toolkit

- Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

## Error boundary

- Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

## React-Router-Dom

- The react-router-dom package contains bindings for using React Router in web application

## Babel

- Babel can be configured using any file extension natively supported by Node.js, as mentioned in Configuration File Types babel.config.json and .babelrc

#
## React Kite

- Kite is Spectrum's  multi-platform design system and framework that provides different standards, tools and assets required for the creation of a cohesive design across all Spectrum digital products and experiences. React Kite is a Kite framework that provides us with different React components that can be used in the applications.

## React Kite Plus

- React Kite Plus is an extension of the React Kite library and included components that are influenced by, but not directly corresponding to the Spectrum Kite design system.
